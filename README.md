##### INTRODUCTION:
Using a dataset of over 1.8 Milion ranked matches, I will try to build predictive models to answer various questions.
Such as:

1. Predict a game's duration
2. Predict a character's role
3. Predict whether a Healer type support would win
4. Predict win/lose
5. Classify various champions to Early/Mid/Late game dominant

Alongside, analyzing raw statistical data such as:
1. Top 10 most played characters for each role
2. Distribution of support types.
3. Win Ratio for healer support types.
4. Average kill and win ratio for AD carries

In this notebooks, various Machine Learning algorithms will be used, both supervised and unsupervised.
While also following specific guidelines which are:
1. Getting familiar with the data
2. Exploring for abnormal values and noise
3. Cleaning the dataset and making it more comfortable to process
4. Visualize the data for better understandment
5. Applying the model for predicting while cross validating the results
6. Tune model features for better results and run the model again.
